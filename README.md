# gp360-SQL-Database-employee-tracker

Employee tracker database built off of MYSQL in combination with node.js and npm inquirer to generate a command line databse.
This database displays an employee's first and last name, role, salary, and department names.
Databse information is inserted from the seeds.sql file which can then be accessed using node.js to display and update information accordingly.
Please see the link to the demonstration video below for details.
